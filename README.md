A collection of stuff a software geek may use to configure their "infrastructure".

## Background

My employer has this good habit of replacing company-issued laptops on a regular (< two years) basis. While the performance boost one typically gets from a hardware refresh is always welcome, manually provisioning the new machine can be cumbersome if not problematic.

Being a full-time [DevOps](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DevOps) believer and part-time practioner, I've decided to put together this repository to help simplify the provisioning process.

## The Toolbox

* Some shell scripts
* [Vagrant](http://www.vagrantup.com/)
* [Puppet](https://puppetlabs.com/puppet/puppet-open-source/)
